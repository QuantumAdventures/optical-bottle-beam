# Code for the Optical Bottle Beam

This repo includes the code to process and analyse the data for the Optical Bottle Beam experiment. Here we are going to present:


* Image processing methodologies to extract and track a Silica microparticle in a .mp4 video.
* Statistical tools to analyse gaussianity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) in the data.
* Functions to calculate Kullback-Leibler divergece between simulation and experiment, allowing to find which value of NA (Numerical Aberture) better fits the one in the experimental setup.
* Potential analysis. From the probability distributions encountered of the microparticle center of mass coordinates, a `curve_fit` is executed considering a quartic potential. The fit results in the extraction of the following constants: $k_\rho$, $k_z$ and $k_{\rho,z}$. These parameters allow the reconstruction of the potential and provide useful insights regarding the optical trap.

## Installation

Well, now, how can you run this code? Follow the next steps.

1. First clone this repo in your computer. This can be done
    * Via SSH:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QuantumAdventures/optical-bottle-beam.git
    ```

    * Via HTTPS:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:QuantumAdventures/optical-bottle-beam.git
    ```

    * Or, by downloading the .zip of the repo and unziping in your computer.

2. Install the requirements, this will set the libraries needed with the correct version in your computer. Inside the main folder of the project run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the data! A `data` folder is needed, to get all the data used and produced in the experiment you can

    * Follow the link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XfC4z9nmNXJuaATl3Da6edwA65mmQBVx), and download it.

    * Or, execute the following command inside the project folder (in the terminal like a boss :sunglasses:)

    ```bash
    ./download.sh
    ```

    For this you are going to need wget (which can be installed with `sudo apt get wget` or `brew install wget`, depending on the OS you use).
    
In the end you should have the following directory structure:

## Usage

With the data downloaded all the notebooks can be executed. To execute the scripts, inside de `optical-bottle-beam` folder run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/calculate_psd_of_experiments.py
```

Or 

```bash
python scripts/calculate_psd_of_simulations.py
```
